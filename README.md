# Stacks

The Stack app or Stack game is a simple game that requires you to time pressing the screen to stack a small board on top of the stack you already made.
If you are able to stack the next board on the exact outline of your current stack you go higher and donâ€™t lose any of your stack width. Unfortunately when you mis-time this and leave some hanging over an edge your stack width shrinks and so does the size of the incoming pieces.
You need to time this right to keep the pieces as large as possible so that you can grow the Stack higher. The game ends when you miss completely with a new piece of the stack.
